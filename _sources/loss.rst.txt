Loss
====

A *loss function* can be defined as a measurement of the discrepancy between the observed data and the predicted data by the fitted function. 
To some extend it can be visualised as a metric of the goodness of a given prediction as you change the settings of your algorithm. 
For example, in a general linear model the loss function is essentially the sum of squared deviations from the fitted line or plane. 


A more useful application in the context of High Energy Physics is the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE).
The MLE is a specific type of probability model estimation, where the loss function is the negative (log)-likelihood.
